# Introduction

In this project, we aim to perform real-time analysis of two popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Our goal is to predict the future price movements of these currencies by training a machine learning model using the river library's linear regression algorithm. By analyzing historical and realtime data, our model will be able to predict whether the price of a currency will go up (represented as 1) or down (represented as 0). This information can be used by customers to make informed decisions about when to buy or sell these currencies.

# Methods
We initially import free binance api and train bitcoin with linear regression model then we train another model with Dogecoin

We'll be combining two models and training them with historical data and then also be incorporating real-time data to improve our predictions. The goal is to figure out if the price of the crypto is likely to go up or down, which can help people decide when to buy or sell.

**Bitcoin**

**Dogecoin**

As a result of our project, we are able to generate profit from this model, which indicates that Dogecoin has the potential to generate a higher return than Bitcoin. It's worth noting that this experimental result was obtained by training the model for only 2 hours. This suggests that with more training, the model's accuracy and potential for profit generation could be further improved.
